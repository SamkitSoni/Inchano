- **Cross-Chain Coordination**: Proper sequencing between source and destination
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Cancellation options when swaps fail

#### 2. Security Features
- **Timelock Protection**: Multiple time windows for different operations
- **Authorization Control**: Role-based access (maker/taker/public)
- **Hash Verification**: Cryptographic secret validation
- **Safety Deposits**: Economic incentives for proper behavior

#### 3. Network Integration
- **Sepolia Testnet**: Configured for Ethereum testnet (as per user preference)
- **Cardano Preprod**: Integration with Cardano testnet
- **Environment Configuration**: Proper `.env` setup and validation

### Technical Architecture

#### Withdrawal Flow Sequence
```
1. Order Creation ‚Üí Relayer Processing
2. Dutch Auction ‚Üí Resolver Selection  
3. Escrow Deployment ‚Üí Source & Destination
4. Timelock Management ‚Üí Window Validation
5. Secret Revelation ‚Üí Withdrawal Execution
6. Cross-Chain Sync ‚Üí Finality Achievement
```

#### Security Model
```
Private Windows: Only authorized parties can act
Public Windows: Anyone can act (with proper secret)
Cancellation: Time-based emergency exits
Safety Deposits: Economic security guarantees
```

### Performance Metrics

#### Benchmark Results
```
üîë Secret Generation: 10ms for 1000 iterations (0.01ms avg)
#Ô∏è‚É£ Hash Generation: 4ms for 1000 iterations (0.00ms avg)  
‚è∞ Timelock Validation: 0ms for 1000 iterations (0.00ms avg)
‚úÖ All operations within acceptable limits
```

#### Scalability Considerations
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple orders can be processed simultaneously
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal computational overhead
- **Network Resilience**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

### Integration Points

#### 1. Relayer Service Integration
- **Health Monitoring**: Service status verification
- **Order Processing**: Signed order validation
- **Event Handling**: Real-time updates and notifications

#### 2. Resolver Network
- **Escrow Deployment**: Automated contract creation
- **Secret Disclosure**: Coordinated revelation across chains
- **Finality Monitoring**: Transaction confirmation tracking

#### 3. Cross-Chain Communication
- **State Synchronization**: Consistent state across chains
- **Event Coordination**: Proper sequencing of operations
- **Failure Recovery**: Rollback and retry mechanisms

### Known Issues and Limitations

#### 1. Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Node-fetch Compatibility**: ES6 module compatibility issue (easily fixable)
- **Relayer Connection**: Network connectivity requirements
- **Development Environment**: Some tests require running services

#### 2. Future Enhancements
